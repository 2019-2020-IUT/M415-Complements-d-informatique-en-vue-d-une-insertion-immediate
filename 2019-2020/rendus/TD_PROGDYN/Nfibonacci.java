/**
 * Computes and prints the first N Fibonacci numbers.
 * <p>
 * WARNING: this program is spectacularly inefficient and is meant to illustrate
 * a performance leak, e.g., set N = 45.
 * <p>
 * REMARKS: the 93rd Fibonacci number would overflow a long, but this will take
 * so long to compute with this function that we don't bother to check for
 * overflow.
 * <p>
 * you may use http://www.miniwebtool.com/list-of-fibonacci-numbers/?number=93

 * Wikipedia: In the Liber Abaci (1202), Fibonacci introduced the so-called
 * modus Indorum (method of the Indians), today known as Arabic numerals (Sigler
 * 2003; Grimm 1973). The book advocated numeration with the digits 0ï¿½9 and
 * place value. The book showed the practical importance of the new numeral
 * system by applying it to commercial bookkeeping, conversion of weights and
 * measures, the calculation of interest, money-changing, and other
 * applications. The book was well received throughout educated Europe and had a
 * profound impact on European thought. Liber Abaci also posed, and solved, a
 * problem involving the growth of a population of rabbits based on idealized
 * assumptions. The solution, generation by generation, was a sequence of
 * numbers later known as Fibonacci numbers. The number sequence was known to
 * Indian mathematicians as early as the 6th century, but Fibonacci's Liber
 * Abaci contains the earliest known description of the sequence outside of
 * India.
 * <p>
 * Fibonacci did not speak about the golden ratio as the limit of the ratio of
 * consecutive numbers in this sequence, ie F(n)/F(n-1) -> (1 + sqrt(5))/2
